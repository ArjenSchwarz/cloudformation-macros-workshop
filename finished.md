# That's all folks

This step is the last step of the workshop, and allows you to test your end result.

## Test that it all works

If you used the recommended name of `NaclExpander` for your Macro, you can simply deploy the `test-vpc.yml` template in the root directory. If you used a different name, you can update the template's `Transform` section to include your chosen name of your Macro instead and then deploy it.

## A challenge

While there is room for improvement in the NaclExpander Macro (and in fact, the one in the finished directory contains a couple tweaks not mentioned in the workshop), it is likely more interesting to think of where a Macro might be useful to you. If you write many CloudFormation templates you probably know what you would like to see improved about it. So, my challenge to you is simply to write your own Macro. Whether it's one that is specific to you or your company, or one that is more broadly useful.

If you end up writing something because of this workshop I'd love to hear about it, so feel free to ping me on Twitter (my handle is @ArjenSchwarz) or use the email address in my GitHub profile.
